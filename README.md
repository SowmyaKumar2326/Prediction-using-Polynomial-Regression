# Prediction-using-Polynomial-Regression
Polynomial regression is a form of regression analysis in which the relationship between the independent variable x and the dependent variable y is modeled as an nth degree polynomial in x. 
This Polymonial Regression model has to predict the Salaries of an Employee based on his Level or Position.This model predicts what Salary should be offered to the new Empolyee.
This model was built in the Jupyter Environment with necessary packages.The Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) helped in selecting the Polynomial Regression model with degree 4.
The built model has an accuracy score of 99.7%.
This model is saved and some samples are also tested.
This type of models can be used in predicting scientific experimental results,finance sectors,progression in diseases etc.
